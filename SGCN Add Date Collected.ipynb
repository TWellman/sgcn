    "This simple script adds an explicit date to the existing items in the SGCN source data repository indicating when the SGCN list applied (either 2005 or 2015). Formerly, this information was only contained in the title, making coding against the repository somewhat ambiguous and brittle. The notebook uses the pysb module to make the update and requires authentication. It should not be run again as there is nothing in the code to ensure that the date collected is not already pleasant. It is considered throwaway code and just useful for transparency in the process."
