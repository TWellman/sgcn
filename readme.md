# SGCN Processing

This repository contains code for processing the data that USGS integrates and synthesizes for the State Species of Greatest Conservation Need. The scripts here start from the [repository](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56d720ece4b015c306f442d5) for original source data collected from the states and stored in ScienceBase. Data are processed into a still experimental online data system we are experimenting with via an API. You'll find the API functionality here, but the codes will not run without a referenced config file containing details and not posted online.
